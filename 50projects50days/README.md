#50 Projects in 50 Days - Pending
Based on the [projects](https://50projects50days.com) designed by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. 
I'm challenging myself to recreate each project without referencing the available material to learn through application as opposed to following a tutorial. It involves alot more googling, but ultimately I'm finding the lessons to stick better.
